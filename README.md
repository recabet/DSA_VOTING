Elector Management Project
Overview
The Elector Management Program is a project implemented in C designed to manage a list of electors efficiently. This document provides an overview of the program's architecture, discusses the implemented functions, and analyzes the complexity of each function.

Additional Structures and Functions
T_Elector_Linked_List creation_T_Elector_Linked_List() Function:
This function allows users to create a linked list of electors by specifying the number of voters and entering their details using the creationelector function. It separates the creation of a linked list from individual elector creation, enhancing code modularity and convenience.

T_Elector insertSorted(T_Elector head, T_Elector newVoter) Function:
This function inserts a new elector into the linked list in alphabetical order based on their names. It decouples the insertion logic from the elector creation process, ensuring a clear separation of concerns in the algorithm.

int alphaOrder(const char *name1, const char *name2) Function:
This utility function compares two string parameters to determine if they are sorted alphabetically. It aids in sorting electors in alphabetical order without cluttering insertion logic, thereby improving code readability and maintainability.

Changed Prototypes
One function prototype was modified to improve elector management efficiency:

T_Elector creationelector(T_Elector head):
This function's prototype was updated to include an additional parameter T_Elector head. This change allows the function to check if a voter with a given ID already exists in the linked list (head) using the findelector function. This ensures that duplicate IDs are not added, enhancing data integrity.

Complexity Analysis
The complexity of each implemented function is outlined below:

T_Elector creationelector(): O(1) - Constant time complexity for creating a single elector.
T_Elector creation_T_Elector_Linked_List(): O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity for creating a linked list of n electors.
void freelist(T_Elector head): O(n) - Linear time complexity for freeing memory associated with n electors.
int findelector(T_Elector head, long cin_num): O(n) - Linear time complexity for searching the list for an elector based on their ID.
void decomposelist(T_Elector originalList, T_Elector *leftList, T_Elector *rightList, T_Elector *whiteList): O(n) - Linear time complexity for dividing the list into three sub-lists.
void deletelector(T_Elector head, long cin_num): O(n) - Linear time complexity for deleting an elector from the list.
void sortlist(T_Elector head): O(n^2) - Quadratic time complexity for sorting the list using the bubble sort algorithm.
T_Elector mergelists(T_Elector headLeft, T_Elector headRight): O(n) - Linear time complexity for merging and sorting two lists.
int countLR(T_Elector headLeft): O(n) - Linear time complexity for counting left-leaning electors in a list.
Conclusion
The Elector Management project is well-structured and designed to efficiently handle elector data. It offers functionalities for adding, deleting, searching, categorizing, and sorting electors based on various attributes. The additional structures and functions enhance the program's functionality and usability, making it a valuable tool for managing elector information effectively.
